# (Mini)RT
A small raytracer using MLX, the graphic library of 42.

GPU utilization is forbidden in this project. To enhance our goal of achieving smooth movement and fast rendering, we implemented multi-threading, pixel shuffling, and an optimized rendering mode during motion. This approach not only improves performance but also ensures a seamless visual experience.
